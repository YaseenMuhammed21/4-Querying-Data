# Retrieving Information from One or More Tables in a Database Using SELECT Statements

SQL provides a powerful set of tools to filter, sort, and manipulate data based on various conditions.

### Below is a description of some of the fundamental SQL queries and operations to retrieve data:

- **SELECT**: Specifies the columns to retrieve.
- **FROM**: Specifies the table(s) from which to retrieve data.
- **WHERE**: Filters the data based on conditions.
- **IN, BETWEEN, LIKE**: Provides more specific filtering.

#### These are some of the key operations to query data in SQL. Depending on your needs, you can combine these clauses to create more complex queries.
