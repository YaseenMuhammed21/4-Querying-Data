# Retrieving information from one or more tables in a database using SELECT statements.

## SQL provides a powerful set of tools to filter, sort, and manipulate data based on various conditions.

### Below is a description of some of the fundamental SQL queries and operations to retrieve data.

SELECT: Specifies the columns to retrieve.
FROM: Specifies the table(s) from which to retrieve data.
WHERE: Filters the data based on conditions.
ORDER BY: Sorts the data.
LIMIT: Limits the number of rows returned.
JOIN: Combines data from multiple tables.
GROUP BY: Groups rows based on specified columns.
HAVING: Filters groups after grouping.
IN, BETWEEN, LIKE: Provides more specific filtering.
These are some of the key operations to query data in SQL. Depending on your needs, you can combine these clauses to create more complex queries.
