# Retrieving information from one or more tables in a database using SELECT statements.

## SQL provides a powerful set of tools to filter, sort, and manipulate data based on various conditions.

### Below is a description of some of the fundamental SQL queries and operations to retrieve data.

SELECT: Specifies the columns to retrieve.
FROM: Specifies the table(s) from which to retrieve data.
WHERE: Filters the data based on conditions.
ORDER BY: Sorts the data.
LIMIT: Limits the number of rows returned.
JOIN: Combines data from multiple tables.
GROUP BY: Groups rows based on specified columns.
HAVING: Filters groups after grouping.
IN, BETWEEN, LIKE: Provides more specific filtering.
These are some of the key operations to query data in SQL. Depending on your needs, you can combine these clauses to create more complex queries.

### SQL Queries for DML Commands

This repository contains a collection of SQL queries designed to test and demonstrate common DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands. These queries include creating tables, inserting data, and retrieving/manipulating records in a relational database. The database structure and commands are intended to help you better understand how to interact with databases using SQL.

1. #### DML Queries

- `Insert Rows`
- `Select Data`

2. #### Table Structure

    The table Managers has the following structure:

    Manager_Id (INT): A unique identifier for each manager.

    First_name (VARCHAR): The first name of the manager.

    Last_name (VARCHAR): The last name of the manager.

    DOB (DATE): The date of birth of the manager.

    Age (INT): The age of the manager with a check constraint (must be greater than or equal to 18).

    Last_update (TIMESTAMP): The timestamp of the last update (defaults to the current time).

    Gender (CHAR(1)): The gender of the manager with a constraint allowing 'M' (Male) or 'F' (Female) or 'O'(Others).

    Department (VARCHAR): The department where the manager works.

    Salary (DECIMAL): The monthly salary of the manager (NOT NULL).
